Outcome

User should be able to add two numbers together
There should be two inputs and a button
When the button is clicked, the sum of the value in the two inputs shows up on the page

Write HTML

Two inputs with ids
    Validate by looking at browser
A button with an id
    Validate by looking at browser
A span with an id
    Validate by looking at browser

Get DOM

Grab the two inputs
    Validate by logging them out
Grab the sum span: the place where we will inject the sum
    Validate by logging it out
Grab the button
    Validate by logging it out

Event Listener (user interaction)

We want to have an 'event listener' on the 'click' of the button
    Validate that the event listener is wired up by logging something ('hello!') out on click
When the user clicks the button: (this is what we do in the event listener's "cool zone")
Get the values of the two inputs
Add together the VALUE of the two inputs
Inject the sum into our sum span
